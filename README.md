## Welcome to Spencer Phillips's Data Science Portfolio

I am a Applied Statistics and Economics double major at the University of California, Davis who is going to graduate in June 2017.

Here is a collection of my data science projects that I have worked on throughout my time at UC Davis. All of the code is going to be in the R or the Python languages.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tallspencer/STA141B/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
